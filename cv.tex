\subsection*{Projects}

\begin{description}
  \item[Fast accumulator startup.]
    In a 10-week internship at 1010data, I was tasked with speeding up the
    core platform login. Logging in involves starting up an accumulator
    process, written in K, to execute the user's requests. My work
    accelerates accumulator startup by introducing a caching mechanism for
    accumulators based on forking: partially started accumulators are
    cached, which allows skipping the loading procedure for new sessions.

  \item[Goto.]
     For a course on compiler design, my partner and I implemented a compiler
     for a subset of Go called GoLite in Haskell. Our compiler featured a
     partial x86\_64 code generator, as well as a complete C++ code generator.
     Our C++ generator emitted faster code than the reference compiler.

     For outstanding achievement in the course, I was personally emailed by the
     professor -- Dr. Laurie Hendren, ACM fellow, Canada Research Chair, and
     fellow of the Royal Society of Canada -- to congratulate me.

  \item[servant-github-webhook.] A Haskell library that provides easy to
    use combinators for the \texttt{servant} web framework for handling
    GitHub webhooks.
