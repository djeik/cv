\subsection*{Projects}

\begin{description}
  \item[Fast accumulator startup.]
    In a 10-week internship at 1010data in New York City, I worked to
    accelerate the core platform login.
    My work achieves this by introducing a caching mechanism:
    new user session processes are now started via forking.
    This mechanism is built as a C extension to the K interpreter, and includes
    a framework for reparenting terminal applications to facilitate debugging.

  \item[Goto.]
     For a course on compiler design, my teammate and I implemented a compiler
     for a subset of Go called GoLite in Haskell. Our compiler featured a
     partial x86\_64 code generator, as well as a complete C++ code generator.
     Our C++ generator emitted faster code than the reference compiler.

     As McGill does not have an A+ grade, Professor Laurie Hendren contacted me
     to award me with an honorary A+ for outstanding achievement in the course.
