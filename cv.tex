\subsection*{Projects}

\begin{description}
    \item[FishBucketChallenge.] To help scientists working on medication for
        ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), in 24 hours my team developed computer
        vision software in Python to track the movement of zebra fish, and
        determine their maximum velocity based only on low-resolution grayscale
        videos of the fish.
    \item[Histograph.] Firefox addon to display browsing history and currently
        open tabs in a side panel as a directed graph. Such a representation
        more adequately reflects the graph-like nature of the web, so it is a
        major improvement over the traditional linear browser history. Built at
        McHacks, Winter 2015.
    \item[TeXnote.] Online environment for creating documents in \LaTeX.
        Document source code is written directly into the browser, and a live
        PDF preview is displayed to the side. The code is compiled server-side,
        so no client installation is needed. The SendGrid API is integrated to
        allow users to easily include scanned images into their documents to
        facilitate rapid document drafting. Built at MHacks, Winter 2015.
        \emph{Winner of the SendGrid API prize.}
    \item[CryptSMS.] TOR for SMS. This tool provides onion routing bolted onto
        the SMS protocol to allow anonymous and private delivery of SMS by
        bouncing messages off a known list of peers. Built at YHack, Fall 2014.

\subsection*{Personal}

I am a classically trained pianist, having taken ten years of private lessons.
I'm passionate about languages and their subtleties. I've taken courses in
Spanish, Modern Greek, and some Mandarin. I also speak the constructed language
Lojban.
My interests include electronic music, roleplaying games, independently
published video games, and free and open source software.
